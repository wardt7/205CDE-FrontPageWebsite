Express ES6 string template engine
======

ES6 Renderer is simple, super fast, and extendable Template Engine for Node and Express applications which uses pure ES6 Javascript syntax.
It works by scanning files in a working directory, then reading the contents of the files and converting them from plain strings to ES6 template strings. ES6 template strings are string literals enclosed by the back-tick. They feature String Interpolation, Embedded Expressions, Multiline strings and String Tagging for safe HTML escaping, localisation, etc. Once convertion is completed its then compiled to plain text by the V8 engine, harnessing 100% of its power. Being less than 1kb, ES6 Renderer offloads a lot of the processing directly to the V8 interpreter, which compiles the code and runs as fast as the rest of the Express App. In fact, ES6 Renderer shouldn't add any overhead to the project at all! It should also allow us to implement any functionality we like within the bounds of Javascript.

Minimum requirements Node.js `v4.0.0`.

### Benchmarks

Testing ES6 Renderer performance was a great opportunity to see how it stacked-up beside others. Our speed test compiled one main template containing an array of string, an object literal and conditional statements.

### Usage

#### Setup

The basics required to integrate ES6 renderer in your app are pretty simple and easy to implement:

```javascript
var express = require('express'),
  es6Renderer = require('express-es6-template-engine'),
  app = express();
  
app.engine('html', es6Renderer);
app.set('views', 'views');
app.set('view engine', 'html');

app.get('/', function(req, res) {
  res.render('index', {locals: {title: 'Welcome!'}});
});

app.listen(3000);
```

Before Express can render template files, the following application settings must be set:

- views, the directory where the template files are located. Eg: app.set('views', './views')
- view engine, the template engine to use. Eg: app.set('view engine', 'html')

HTML template file named index.html in the views directory is needed, with the following content:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>${title}</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>${title}</h1>
</body>
</html>
```
Route to render the index.html file is expected. If the view engine property is not set, we must specify the extension of the view file. Otherwise, it can be safely omitted.

```javascript
app.get('/', function(req, res) {
  res.render('index', {locals: {title: 'Welcome!'}});
});
```
Express-compliant template engines such as ES6 Renderer export a function named __express(filePath, options, callback), which is called by the res.render() function to render the template code. When a request is made to the home page, the index.html file will be rendered as HTML.

#### Rendering a template

Within your app route callback, call `res.render`, passing any partials and local variables required by your template. For example:

```javascript
res.render('index', {
    locals: {
      title:  'Welcome!'
    },
    partials: {
      template: 'template.html'
    }
  });
```

Having the index.html file with the following content in your view directory is need:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>${title}</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>${title}</h1>
    <main>${template}</main>
</body>
</html>
```

Partial template with a file name template.html will be injected into index.html:

```html
<div>No learning of a template engine syntax required! Pure vanilla javascript certified!</div>
```

The content below will be rendered on the client side as a response from the Express app:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>Welcome</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Welcome!</h1>
    <div>No learning of a template engine syntax required! Pure vanilla javascript certified!</div>
</body>
</html>
```

All templates files paths are defined as absolute to the root directory of the project.

#### Compiling a string

ES6 Renderer rendering functionality has separate scanning, parsing, string generation and response sending phases. Compilation is pretty much the same but without the response sending phase. This feature can be useful for pre-processing templates on the server.
Compiling has the following syntax:

```javascript
const titleTpl = '${engineName} - The fastest javascript template string engine!';
const cb = (err, content) => err || content;

// async - second parameter is an object and third parameter is a callback function
es6Renderer(titleTpl, {locals:{engineName: 'ES6 Renderer'}, cb);
// sync - second parameter is a string representation of an array of variable names.
// The returned function is called with a string representation of an array of variable values.
const compiled = es6Renderer(titleTpl, 'engineName')('ES6 Renderer');
```
The template engine allows both synchronous and asynchronous method invocations. If string is rendered as in the examples provided above a 'template' option needs to be set to true. The preceding synchronous invocation returns an output immediately in response to the function execution. Alternatively, you can specify partials and omit template parameter to force file lookup and content reading and invoke the function asynchronously. 


#### Compiling a template

The two functions `app.render` and `es6Renderer` are almost identical, but they require slightly different parameters to be passed. While `app.render` uses an absolute path, or a path relative to the views setting, `es6Renderer` expects a path relative to root folder.
They both return the rendered content of a view via the callback function. The callback function which is provided as a third parameter is called once the asynchronous activity is completed. The output in the two examples provided below is the same:

```javascript
app.render('index', {
  partials: {
    template: 'template'
  }
}, (err, content) => err || content);
```
```javascript
es6Renderer('view/index.html', {
  partials: {
    template: 'views/template.html'
  }
}, (err, content) => err || content);
```
On average `es6Renderer` yields slightly better performance than `app.render`. Async function invocation of `es6Renderer` also returns a promise, which enables us to chain method calls:
```javascript
const compile = es6Renderer('view/index.html', {
  partials: {
    template: 'views/template.html'
  }
}, (err, content) => err || content);
compile.then(output => res.send(output))
```

#### Compiling a nested template

Template nesting is currently not supported by the engine. A simple workaround to this issue would be to perform multiple template compilations:

```javascript
const renderPage = (err, content) => res.render('index', {
  locals: {
    template: content
  },
  partials: {
    main: 'templateC'
  }
});
es6Renderer('view/templateA.html', {
  partials: {
    template: 'views/templateB.html'
  }
}, renderPage);
```
#### Precompiling

ES6 Renderer allows us bypassing Express view rendering for speed and modularity. Compiling a template is much slower than rendering it, so when it comes to speed, we should precompile our templates as part of the optimisation process. The result of precompilation can be stored to an object:
```javascript
const text = '${engineName} - The fastest javascript template string engine in the whole ${place}!';
const precompiled = es6Renderer(text, 'engineName, place');
```
and then invoked whenver needed:
```javascript
console.log(precompiled('ES6 Renderer', 'multiverse'));
```
To make use of this precompilation, templates should be compiled with names that the compiler would expect and the result function called with an argument list that consists of values relative to the names. If no property name is defined a default one is created with a value of '$': 
```javascript
const text = '${$.engineName} - The fastest javascript template string engine in the whole ${$.place}!';
console.log(es6Renderer(text)({ engineName: 'ES6 Renderer', place: 'multiverse' });
```
This allows us to create an application that is more flexible, independent from a framework, easier to understand and better performing.



#### Conditional statements

ES6 Renderer dynamically evaluates code in JavaScript. If the argument is an expression, ES6 Renderer evaluates the expression. If the argument is one or more JavaScript statements, the engine executes the statements. A simplified example of using conditional statement is presented below.

A route path on the server side:

```javascript
res.render('index', {
    locals: {
      maintainedBy:  'Good Samaritans'
    }
  });
```

And a conditional statement in a html file like the one below:

```html
ES6 Renderer is ${maintainedBy ? `a template engine maintained by ${maintainedBy}` : 'not maitaned anymore'}.
```

Will result in the following:

```html
ES6 Renderer is a template engine maintained by Good Samaritans.
```

#### Iterators

Iterating over arrays and objects is quite straight forward and intuitive (knowledge of basic javascript here is essential). An object literal is passed to a html template:

```javascript
res.render('index', {
    locals: {
      features:  [
      { 
        dt: 'Multi-line strings', 
        dd: 'Any new line characters inserted in the source are part of the template string.' 
      },
      { 
        dt: 'Expression interpolation', 
        dd: 'Template strings can contain placeholders. These are indicated by dollar sign and curly braces.' 
      },
    ]
    }
  });
```

The html templates holds the following logic:

```html
<dl>
  ${features.map(f => `
    <dt>${f.dt}</dt>
    <dd>${f.dd}</dd>
  `).join('')}
</dl>
```

And the following is received by the client side:

```html
<dl>
    <dt>Multi-line strings</dt>
    <dd>Any new line characters inserted in the source are part of the template string.</dd>
    <dt>Expression interpolation</dt>
    <dd>Template strings can contain placeholders. These are indicated by dollar sign and curly braces.</dd>
</dl>
```
